# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The project took an input file, read data from the file, output a backup of the compiled data, then provided the user with a menu of options to display the data on screen in real-time.
  
# What did you do particularly well?
  I solved the problem while also segmenting my program into separate supporting files rather than including it all in one spaghetti code file.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I did not use <maps> as recommended.  The reason being, I wasn't sure where to implement a class if I wasn't using a list of classes to store the data.  The projected required I implement a class somehow and that was the best way I could think to do it.  I'll push myself next time to write this code with maps.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The most challenginng parts of this code were the input validation and the data read/write loop.  It took me a minute to figure out how to handle input validaiton through the c++ console given scenarios where the user button-mashes--but I figured it out.  On the other hand, it was quite a challenge figuring out how to make the code read the input file while also populating a unique list, and the frequencies for that unique list all in one loop.  It took some trial and error and I eventially got the sequence of actions right.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Structuring clean loops and building good supporting documentation will definitely serve me in future work.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I commented on every line of code, I separated the overall script into modular supporting files, and I kept things generic enough to be expanded as needed.  I think this project would be easy for an unfamiliar coder to pick up and carry on.
